# Notinhas documentation map

Flow-first entrypoint for humans and agents working in Notinhas. Start here, then open the doc that owns your topic.

## Product focus

Notinhas optimizes **capture → annotate with numbered pins/notes → clipboard export**. Inherited upstream docs describe shared capture, history, and annotate machinery — keep them accurate when touching those flows.

## Runtime overview

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Launch Notinhas"] --> B["AppDelegate + AppCoordinator"]
    B --> C["Identity + sandbox migrations"]
    C --> D["DatabaseManager + capture services"]
    D --> E["Menu bar / capture / annotate"]
    E --> F["Export + clipboard handoff"]
```

## Agent routing

- Notinhas pins/export → `.agents/skills/capture-annotate-export/SKILL.md`
- Build/test gates → `delivery-workflow`
- Repo policy → `project-standards` and root `AGENTS.md`

## Legacy compatibility note

Source and migration code may reference **legacy Snapzy** paths (`Snapzy/`,
`snapzy.db`, `snapzy://`) only for one-time import or rejection tests.
User-facing docs and automation should use **Notinhas** paths and
`notinhas://` unless explicitly documenting legacy migration inputs in
[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).
