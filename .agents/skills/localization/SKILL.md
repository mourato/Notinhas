# Localization

Use when adding or changing user-visible strings, tooltips, permission toasts, or empty-state copy for Notinhas or shared Annotate UI.

## Rules

- User-facing text lives in Snapzy localization (`*.xcstrings`) and `NotinhasL10n` where Notinhas-specific.
- Keep tone short and direct — designer handoff, not marketing prose.
- Use stable keys; do not concatenate sentences in code for grammar-sensitive languages.
- Accessible labels should describe the action (“Add note”, “Copy to clipboard”, “Upload image”), not only the visual glyph.
- Technical tokens (HEX in upstream features, file formats) may stay locale-stable; surrounding chrome can localize.
- Avoid hard-coded English in new permission/error toasts when a strings table exists.

## Checklist

- Are new strings reachable for `Localizable.strings` / xcstrings extraction?
- Do Notinhas note editor labels localize consistently with Annotate chrome?
