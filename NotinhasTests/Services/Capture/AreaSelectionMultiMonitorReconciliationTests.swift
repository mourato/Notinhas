  /// Regression for the multi-monitor bug: area selection worked on the PRIMARY display but froze
  /// (no drag rectangle, coordinate indicator stuck) on a SECONDARY display when the capture session
  /// started with empty `selectionBackdrops` and an async backdrop later landed only on the primary.
  ///
  /// Root cause: `AreaSelectionOverlayView.selectionEnabled` is a view-local cached bool, set only via
  /// `setSelectionEnabled(_:)`. The controller's authoritative `selectionEnabled(for:)` is:
  ///   `selectionBackdrops.isEmpty || selectionBackdrops[displayID] != nil ||
  /// liveFallbackDisplayIDs.contains(displayID)`
  /// The FIRST call to `applyBackdrop(_:for:)` flips `selectionBackdrops.isEmpty` from true to false,
  /// which changes the authoritative answer for EVERY OTHER display -- but before the fix, only the
  /// mutated display's pooled window had its cached flag refreshed. A secondary window's cached flag
  /// stayed stale `true`, so its `mouseDown` skipped the live-fallback rescue path, and the later
  /// authoritative re-check in `beginManualSelection` then correctly said "disabled" -- leaving
  /// `manualSelectionStartPoint` nil and no drag monitors installed. The fix added
  /// `reconcileSelectionEnabledAcrossPooledWindows()`, invoked from `applyBackdrop(_:for:)` right after
  /// `selectionBackdrops[displayID] = backdrop`, which loops EVERY pooled window (not just the one
  /// being mutated) and re-syncs its cached flag to the fresh `selectionEnabled(for:)` value.
  ///
  /// LIMITATION: `AreaSelectionController.windowPool` only ever contains one entry per currently
  /// connected `NSScreen`, and there is no public/internal seam to inject a synthetic secondary
  /// display's window into that private pool from a test running on a single-display machine (or CI
  /// runner). To still exercise the real fix end-to-end (not just re-derive its formula), this test
  /// uses the SINGLE real pooled window as the "secondary" stand-in: its cached flag is seeded to the
  /// stale `true` value a real secondary would have, then `applyBackdrop(_:for:)` is called for a
  /// DIFFERENT, synthetic displayID that has no pooled window (mirroring "the primary's backdrop
  /// arrived, but this window belongs to some other display"). Because
  /// `reconcileSelectionEnabledAcrossPooledWindows()` iterates ALL of `windowPool` regardless of which
  /// displayID was just mutated, this drives the exact same code path a real secondary window would
  /// go through. Without the fix, `applyBackdrop(_:for:)` for an unpooled displayID mutates
  /// `selectionBackdrops` and then hits `guard let window = windowPool[displayID] else { return }` --
  /// returning immediately WITHOUT ever touching the real window's cached flag, leaving it stuck on
  /// stale `true`. A true multi-window assertion (two independently pooled real windows) would require
  /// actual multi-monitor hardware, which is not available in this unit test environment.
